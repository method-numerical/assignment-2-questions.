while compiling factorial using only c time was so short that output was 0.000000000000. 

But in other case these were finite. 

This implies that using only c is fast . . . .

Another case is that using scipy function python can calculate factorial of very big integers, but using c program factorial of large numbers could not be possible even if using long int data type . . . .
